What is Conky?
Conky is a lightweight free system monitor available on Linux and BSD. It can display the system information and statistics such as CPU consumption, disk usage, RAM utilization, network speed etc in an elegant way. All the information is displayed on top of your wallpaper. It gives your desktop a live wallpaper feel.

The looks of the displayed information can be changed via Conky configuration file.

The problem with Conky is that it is more of a text-based application. Which means you have to change its configuration file to tweak the display. Though Conky is extremely configurable and you can change every aspect of it by modifying its configuration file. But the complex way of installing and configuring Conky usually scares away the Linux beginners.

Don’t worry! You can still use Conky easily thanks to a GUI tool called Conky Manager. I’ll show you both GUI and command line way of installing Conky themes.

Let’s start with GUI method first.

Run command:
conky -c Downloads/conky_test.conf
